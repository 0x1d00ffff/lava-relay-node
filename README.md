## Lava Relay Node




##### Redis Tables

  Will use a hashmap for 'peers'  (hash of ip address)

  Will use a hashmap for 'packets'


  Will make a express web interface to see the status of the mempool and peers - could be served over http or just local


### TODO

1. Add oracles and render them on web server
2. Allow for lava packets to be POSTed in and render them on web server
